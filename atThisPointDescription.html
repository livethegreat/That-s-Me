    On this song, Live takes us through his introspection process, where his self-doubts start to creep in. 
    In the first verse, he confronts his negative thoughts,
    which he presents as the devil's thoughts - one of the numerous biblical annotations he uses in this mixtape.
    We learn that although he pretends to be confident as he tries to refute the Devil,
    he has fears and frustrations that pull him down. 
    In the second verse, Live takes us through the conversation he had with the devil when he first started writing raps. The devil 
    tries to convince Live that this world is bad for him, and uses his past experiences to justify that nothing really works out for him. 
    In this verse, Live goes on to express the suicidal thoughts he had upon his mother's death and that it was his fear of leaving nothing behind that saved him.

    We also discover that the devil warned Live, shortly after his mother died, about a family member who would betray him, which he did not believe. Turns out the devil was right, which proved to him that the Devil could see the future, and knows exactly where he will end up. This appreciation of the Devil’s power has him reconsidering that suicide route. 
    On the third verse, Live puts us at the scenery of his late step-brother's funeral, who apparently committed suicide at a young age. Live does not know why he committed suicide; but all he knew was that life was not easy for his step-brother, and that he died without his father ever accepting him as one of his sons.
    To Live, his sudden death added more weight to the Devil's argument. Live saw himself in him; he saw someone who was pushed by the devil over the edge of life; lead to believe that this world was bad for him, and died before he could create a legacy. The circumstances of his death were Live’s worst nightmare; to leave this world and be easily forgotten.
    
    The songs ends with Live at a crossroads; either working towards his dreams, which seem to grow further away from him - or to free himself from this world's tragedies. We witness how he came about his decision in his next song on the Mixtape, "Toss and Turn".
