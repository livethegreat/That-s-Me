    [Verse 1]<br>
    I'm a fish swimming in the cauldron, it's awful, it's hot water<br>
My life's over, better jump over this bitches 'fore they come over<br>
I'm sacred to, die without fighting over my life so<br>
If l run the rings around y'all, you the ground beneath my feet<br>
So fuck your middle ground asshole, I break the chains, l breed success,<br>
l thump my chest, I wage a guerilla war, I'm pissed off<br>
Time l got is too short and for sure this life is brutal<br>
Privileges going awol, dreams already took of<br>
Now I'm forced to live like McCoy, oh boy with less I'll make more<br>
Wreak havoc and cause the chaos fuck life orders l choose war,<br>
times of storms l pray for peacefulness l hate war,<br> 
Stiffen up my sinews imitate the tigers actions<br>
If l have to, write my words on the history board I'm an icon<br>
Take my time ingest the spirit of hip hop 'til i'm a top notch,<br>
Bridges unto riches are fragile and so the most fall<br>
If l claim l never prayed never to fall I'm just a liar.<br>
<br>

[Choras]<br>
I've been beaten, to some extent<br>
l had some doubts but guess what? when l look into my mirror<br>
I see my feet are like those made of bronze, that glows into<br>
The furnace l hear my voice is like a sound of a waterfall<br>
I keep staring, coming from mouth<br>
Is a double edged sword, look at the sky i am coming<br>
With clouds, eyes blazing with fire my face is like<br>
A sun shining In it's brilliance, so l keep staring<br>
<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Got a wish and l wish l would talk about peace in my music<br>
The music people could listen and relate to, but they won't<br> 
cause it's thin on the ground to talk about love in this game<br> 
I love my chick, lemma rephrase that l fuck with that bitch<br>
Wish l get riches, visions of quitting kissing your asses<br>
The fruits of hip hop are relished by man we view as conceit<br>
Buckle in with a bit of a grin and tackle the thing that cannot be<br>
Done, take of your coat and start to do it<br>
Hate your haters for saying your passion will be diminished<br>
For me my brother said that shit, for sure he doesn't hate me<br>
Thousand reasons you won't make it, losts are better than you<br>
The competition with thousand dazzling but no one is you<br>
I'm not illustrious, which means got insufficient fucks to give<br>
And l can say what l wanna say, without a consequence<br> 
I vision juggling the Coast and New York, I'm not a joke<br>
Cause if you think Live is jus here to visit then you wrong.<br>
<br>

[Choras]<br>
I've been beaten, to some extent<br>

I keep staring, coming from mouth<br>
Is a double edged sword, look at the sky i am coming<br>
With clouds, eyes blazing with fire my face is like<br>
A sun shining In it's brilliance, so l keep staring<br>
