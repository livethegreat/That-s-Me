"Win” is the opening track in Live's debut mixtapeThat's Me.
On this song Live talks about his dreams of filling a spot in the hip hop Industry,
and how he wishes that it embraces him.
While big artists worry about staying relevant, Live is searching for relevance.
This song not only reveals his intent to make a name for himself,
but also reveals his frustrations towards his father, for reasons which are further explored in the mixtape.
<br>
<br>

We uncover that Live's issues with his father affect his relationship with his little brother;
and that he yearns to not only inspire him but to also grow closer to the rest of his estranged family. 
This song also reveals a sense of urgency in Live's life,
we learn that he is under pressure to be financially independent.
He explicitly states that he feels like a burden to his grandmother, 
regardless of how she continues to believe and invest in his dreams. 
And while under this immense pressure to be successful, 
Live has some self doubts, which he takes us through on the following song “At this point”.
