    This song is about Live's mother, before and after her death and how these situations
    shaped Live's perspective about life.
    On the first verse Live revists the relationship he and his mother had when he was still a teenager,
    how she guided his daily routines- which signifies her protectiveness of him,
    how she encouraged him when he was getting low grades at school
    and how she taught him to believe that God will always be his protector.
    Once again, Live recalls the days he did not want to see his father due to the use of alcohol.
    However, his mother is suggesting Live to visit his father, for the sake of peace.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the second verse, Live puts us on the scenery when his mother had a critical illness.
    We learn that Live believed in miracles and had hope that God will heal his mother.
    However, his mother died, and that was when he started questioning God.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the third verse, Live expresses his anger on life it's self.
    He exclaims that "miseries and pain will always stay a mystery",
    and that religion does not save people from the chaos that life brings.
    However, he is still afraid that he might die
    before he fills a stack of books with his thoughts and emotions as a songwriter.
    He expresses that he would thank God if he would die after he has fulfilled his dreams,
    and that he wants to die proud of himself.
