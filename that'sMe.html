    [Verse 1]<br> 
Niches of languages, in the hip hop<br> 
Industry, l noticed many prefer English<br> 
But It's challenging to thrive and survive if you living<br>  
In South Africa, some were using their mother<br>  
Tongues, they made it locally<br> 
Others dreamt further, they hoped the world would listen<br> 
See their views but ooh that is a tough position<br>  
That's a bet, they either compete with more<br>  
People or accused of faking US, hip hop<br> 
It's inevitable, so they don't have a choice<br>  
But to try and escape from these speculations<br> 
Forced to use mother tongues, sacrificing their dreams<br>  
Soo what does it take<br> 
Really to make it global?<br> 
<br> 

[Verse 2]<br> 
Is it a language or skill, creativity or what?<br> 
Wish l could answer that coz I'd be running the world<br> 
But for other people, I'm guessing that<br> 
Would be an easy question to answer, answers<br> 
That are based on the style or character that is a reflection<br> 
Of those at the top, so of course everyone<br> 
Is gonna mirror this style to thrive,<br>  
Tightening the competition, and many people<br>  
Will struggle to get attention, coz if we devalue<br> 
The individual talent in rap for sure<br>
Hip hop's gonna die, l was advised<br>
As an artist who wants to make it, to use mother tongue<br>
In order to be different, keep it real<br>
And staying true to where I'm coming from<br>
Where l could get attention even make a living<br> 
So l had a question, do l have<br>
To keep my circle small? does rapping in my language<br> 
Determine my talent, and my uniqueness?<br>
One question lead to more questions, do l<br>
Depend on my language to convey my culture?<br>
The biggest question of them all, why did l choose this<br>
In the first place? Hhm,<br> 
As much as I'm yearning to make it<br>
I'm willing to follow my destiny,<br> 
spend some time with my inner self, regardless<br> 
Of how l should be doing things,<br>
And that's me<br>
