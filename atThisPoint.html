[Verse 1]<br>
Today I'm Live tomorrow l will and yesterday l was<br>
Look I'm the man you can count on but not to shit on<br>
I got my own flaws and laws, laws everybody has<br>
Read the room, you should know no but quits when they got no<br>
Place to go, your honesty, is it gonna make me<br>
Give up? I got 'em laws of course, not one of them says<br>
l should listen to nonsense, who said l need your 2 cent?<br>
You a smart person yet you disappointing
Cause you talk<br>
Too much, you don't even need a warning you'd be proud<br>
You special and unusual and suitable<br> 
Then you met Live you lost your motivation and passion<br> 
Days are numbered, now let them say l walked with giants<br>
I never changed people left and people came but I'm still<br>
The same person with the same passion and vision<br> 
I never sleep, coz sleep is the cousin of death<br>
When l try, l can hear my mother breath in her death<br>
<br>

[Choras]<br>
At this point is it my passion<br>
Or my fear that drives me everyday?<br>
Maybe God is answering my mother's prayers for sure<br>
Maybe that's a myth,but i'm sure<br>
I can forsee the future, so i talk to myself<br>
Just take off your coat and do what can't be done keep in mind<br>
I'm also your mom, talk to me<br>
If you got a problem, got it?<br>
<br>



[Verse 2]<br>
I used to say, if my mother dies I will commit suicide<br> 
Cowardice my savior, he said no one will cry for me<br>
"Look around what would you leave? You got nothing"<br>
The devil on the other side said l made a promise<br> 
He said the world is unfair to me it will be worse<br>
Then he went on and said there is a snake inside your your house<br>
Of course l did not believe in that 'cause that's my family<br>
Member that she's talking about she knew my mom<br>
Then l found the reason why she was kind l was surprised<br> 
Disappointed yet in disgust l was betrayed<br> 
In the mist of all this l had to vent my pain out<br>
I started to rap, the Devil was in my ear<br>
Reminding me of my passion,passion l had for soccer,<br> 
"Thought you was gonna make it" until you found out you not capable<br>
Poor boy this is not the world for the miserable<br> 
It's sinister, with fake preachers and fake lovers<br>
<br>

[Choras]<br>
At this point is it my passion<br>
Or my fear that drives me everyday?<br>
Maybe God is answering my mother's prayers for sure<br>
Maybe that's a myth,but i'm sure<br>
I can forsee the future, so i talk to myself<br>
Just take off your coat and do what can't be done keep in mind<br>
I'm also your mom, talk to me<br>
If you got a problem, got it?<br>
<br>


[Verse 3]<br>
Once upon a time there was a man who committed<br> 
suicide when he was alive there was a rumor that<br>
We were sharing the same blood he was my father son<br>
My father said the rumors are lies and he never had love<br>
for his rumored son so am l, l never cared<br>
He was my brother or not,son of my father wasn't close<br>
But at the funeral people never cried but just a few<br>
it was a law one might think it was but wasn't<br>
He died in everybody's mind,God's mind<br>
And even his and l was terrified 'cause devil eyes<br> 
Were gazing into my eyes,blind eyes in luck.<br>
Grew symptoms of suicide so this could be my<br>
Last dice I'm throwing and now I'm hoping it counts<br>
It's a lie if l say I've never given my best<br>
<br>

[Choras]<br>
At this point is it my passion<br>
Or my fear that drives me everyday?<br>
Maybe God is answering my mother's prayers for sure<br>
Maybe that's a myth,but i'm sure<br>
I can forsee the future, so i talk to myself<br>
Just take off your coat and do what can't be done keep in mind<br>
I'm also your mom, talk to me<br>
If you got a problem, got it?<br>
