    [Verse 1]<br>
    Cruel and brutal life we chained to, the living<br> 
Are in pieces, others picked to cease to exist, for the silence<br> 
Live brush your teeth and wash your face my darling<br> 
I'm telling you everything, l cannot always be there<br> 
Flush your phone in the toilet to keep our ears at ease<br>
Jeez jus leave and pack your things l would be pleased<br>
I noticed, you not flourishing at school<br> 
But promise one thing that you'll propel your limit until you achieve<br> 
Your mission, for peace sake, your father<br>
Wants you to visit him, but that is pissing you off<br>
With him you bound to turn wine to water to get along<br> 
Still in teenage to make decisions<br> 
Hence l would be at fault, it would seem like it's me<br>
Turning you against him, you my son and my angel<br>
I'd never lead you to hell, in my absence have faith<br>
That Jesus Christ the savior, will put you under his wing<br>
<br>
[Choras]<br>
If only my anguish and misery could be weighed<br>
It would surely outweigh the sum of sand in the sea<br>
When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
'Til it's dawn I stare while God snatches away<br>
From my hands i'm mad I can't fight for myself<br>
When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Serious illness ey mom? really why tell me now?<br>
"He will drown in his tears" I figured you would say that<br>
Guess what, It is a blessing that Jesus's setting you free<br>
From this sickness I'm praying l promise you gon' be healed<br> 
Days passed without change, l wasn't patient with pain<br>
And the doctors either so l decided to pressure the lord:<br>
"To the one that created the foundations of this earth<br> 
I've been knocking on your door and if you sleeping wake up"<br>
This is the moment when was l losing my shit<br>
Losing mom and there was nothing l could do at this phase<br>
Prayed not to lose faith, was a wreck when situations<br> 
Went from to better to worse, "life happens to all"<br>
I beg to differ, I'm under God's protection<br> 
While my mom's still sick, reason why I'm praying<br> 
Life should be lenient but mother died regardless<br>
Thinking what could be more tragic under God's protection<br> 
<br>

[Choras]<br>
If only my anguish and misery could be weighed<br>
It would surely outweigh the sum of sand in the sea<br>
When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
'Til it's dawn I stare while God snatches away<br>
From my hands i'm mad I can't fight for myself<br>
When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
<br>


[Verse 3]<br>
I'm a sheep without a shepard, and l am walking<br>
Surrounded by tons of predators, grit my teeth<br>
And raise my spirit one of us will die, or sleep in hell<br>
But who is brave enough to question jesus? say "l don't<br>
Deserve this", and who would understand his perspective?<br>
Miseries and pain will always stay a mystery<br> 
Prayers fade when you fathom you not different at all<br>
Everybody's troubles are fated and so we striving to linger<br>
Whether you christian or not, people say<br>
The darkest hour is near the dawn, nothing good<br>
At all came out from my mother's death surely l have<br> 
Fears that I may cease to be, before I've written<br> 
My parables in my rhythmic book of rhymes and fill up<br>
My pages with all thoughts like a garner, harvesting<br> 
All my grain and fill it in the storeroom,<br> 
If that day would come through, surely I'd die with pride and gratitude.<br>
<br>
[Choras]<br>
If only my anguish and misery could be weighed<br>
It would surely outweigh the sum of sand in the sea<br>
When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
'Til it's dawn I stare while God snatches away<br>
From my hands i'm mad I can't fight for myself<br>
When i'm trying to sleep, my dreams come up with waves<br>
Of night terros i'm scared, so I toss and I turn<br>
