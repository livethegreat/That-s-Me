    [Verse]<br>
    I told my mom that I'm gonna reach my prime<br>
    I'm corny coz that's everybody's life<br>
    Some made it and some failed it
    I don't know why<br>
    Pick a goal you wanna score
    the questions how?<br>
    Never give up is old school But also true<br>
    Some day you gonna pray you make it too<br>
    Die like a giant and the day you die they shook<br>
    Street wet of tears, man they loved you too<br>
    Just planning my life man surviving too<br>
    Tell my haters to keep hating it's all they can do<br>
    Say it's luck I'm fortunate when l can't lose<br>
    If l die today my name dies today<br>
    Now I'm working my ass off to make it live<br>
    I'm not special I'm just joining the game to win<br>
    And see what l can offer for the game 'til when<br>
    23 years old and still dependent?<br>
    This is too much pressure especially grandma<br>
    Picture feeding your grandson you not even sure<br>
    Where you wasting your time when you was feeding this boy?<br>
    I know you believe in me grandma you don't have choice<br>
    Lil' brother l know we not close because <br>
    With our family issue we never gonna be close<br>
    Pray it's never too late, promise I'll be back<br>
    I wanna come back with something and see the smile on your face<br>
    Everything your dad says is wrong 'bout me<br>
    And it's hard to tell who my family is<br>
    They say a man is no man with family<br>
    God save me I'm losing my manhood again<br>
    I've studied the game l saw the man losing his fans,<br>
    These are your fans you can't call 'em family<br>
    You lost your fans? You gonna lose friends<br>
    Replace the friend you always thought you had<br>
    Nowadays I'm mad because it's hard to find<br>
    A fan to listen to this song l made<br>
    I'm gonna force people to respect my name<br>
    And when l move the mountain do not say it's luck<br>
    To rap like this it never takes a day<br>
    It don't matter whether I'm really working hard or not<br>
    The plan is just to keep working or die<br> 
    I do shit somehow you will be say class<br>
    The next shit, you gonna be saying it's trash<br>
    Who cares as long as l don't hate myself<br> 
    Big artists are worrying about the state of the game<br>
    They wanna know if they still connect with fans<br>
    I wonder if I'm gonna connect at all<br>
    I got a lot to say though I got no time<br> 
    For punchlines and word plays cause that will change<br>
    The narrative of what l wanna say<br>
    Good fellas this is not to entertain yourselves<br> 
    I'm tryna catch your ear, you might be interested by<br>
    Shit l wanna say to you l write my<br>
    Lines without having to compromise them<br>
    They plain and that's a lack of creating punchlines<br> 
    Who cares about your top lists goats and shit,<br>
    This poor land of mine you think l care<br>
    About people saying I'm good at what l do?<br>
    I do care about that but now I got a mission<br>
    To get rich and spend time with my family<br> 
    But now my circle is becoming smaller<br>
    And to be honest l think I'm scared as fuck(shit)<br>
    To be alone in this alarming world.<br>
